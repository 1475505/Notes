# Fundamentals of Quantitative Design and Analysis

## Introduction

- Why Architecture?
1. First, the virtual elimination of assembly language programming reduced the need for object-code compatibility. 
2. the creation of standardized, vendor-independent operating systems, such as UNIX and its clone, Linux, lowered the cost and risk of bringing out a new architecture.
- RISC
1. instruction-level parallelism (pipelining -> multiple instruction issue)
2. caches (more sophisticated organizations and optimizations).
